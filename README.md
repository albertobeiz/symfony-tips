## Symfony Tips #08 - Flush in an Event Subscriber

To remove the EntityManagerInterface and any other database related code from our Use Case we will use another Symfony EventSubscriber.

### This is OK

```php

    public function __invoke(Request $request):  User | Response
    {
        .
        .
        .
        $this->userRepository->persist($user);
        $this->entityManager->flush();
        .
        .
        .
    }
 ```   

### This is better

```php

    public function __invoke(Request $request):  User | Response
    {
        .
        .
        .
        $this->userRepository->persist($user);
        .
        .
        .
    }
 ```   

```php

    class OnView_Flush implements EventSubscriberInterface
    {
        public function __construct(
            private EntityManagerInterface $entityManager
        )
        {
        }
    
        public static function getSubscribedEvents(): array
        {
            return [
                KernelEvents::VIEW => 'onView'
            ];
        }
    
        public function onView() {
            $this->entityManager->flush();
        }
    }
```    

### Why?

**flush()** is a database level operation and we want our Use Case to speak business.

This solution will call flush even if we don't do any database operation but it's a good tradeoff and the performance degradation is almost inexistent.

We are almost there! We have to deal with error messages (it's http and, guess what, http is not business code ðŸ˜›) and we're ready to test it.

You can re-run **test.sh** to see that everything keeps working.
